existing saga
Dazzling effects and enthusiastic performances launch the latest entry into the MCU with finesse. Cumberbatch delivers an intriguing character who expertly fits the successful design of Marvel's recent protagonists, matching heroic action and paced humor without succumbing to predictable constraints, and a well-balanced cast of expert actors and actresses carries a script filled with action, comedy, and mystery. Scott Derrickson's direction ties it all together without ever disengaging viewers, resulting in one of the most entertaining and visually magnificent spectacles of the MCU to date. A worthy entry to the existing saga and a thoroughly entertaining film on its' own, "Doctor Strange" entrances and excites -- well worth a chance from Marvel loyalists and newcomers alike.

top MCU
One of the top few MCU movies, visually stunning, thrilling and much funnier than I was expecting (for some reason). I'd heard about the whitewashing thing, and while it's certainly unfortunate and problematic, and Michelle Yeoh (for instance) would probably have also made a good Ancient One, Tilda is undeniably fantastic in the role (as always). Ditto Benibatch, Ejiofor, McAdams, Wong and Mikkelsen. Given the magical stuff, it felt a bit apart from the other Avenger movies - not a bad thing - but as soon as Wong said 'infinity stone' it slid into place. Time will tell (sorry) how the good doctor plays with the established (and yet to be established) Avengers, but as a standalone film this one rocks.

Good flick
Shockingly good. Definitely a need to see in theater, I think special effects may lose something at home on tv. Good flick

outstanding film
An amazing addition to the MCU, Doctor Strange is an outstanding film with one of the best visual effects seen in any superhero film. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect man for the job as the mind-bending Doctor Strange.

The effects were amazing. Doctor Strange is one of the few movies that actually makes good use of 3D. And the writers brought a healthy helping of funny.

Dr Strange sums up what going to the movies is all about. The stunning visual, complimented by a charming protagonist and with a neat story that doesn't attempt to be too smart or condescending. Strange is a wonderful watch.

special effects
Its like a bunch of special effects guys get together and see what kind of awesome crap they can pull off this time
Shockingly good. Definitely a need to see in theater, I think special effects may lose something at home on tv. Good flick
Brilliantly acted and directed, Doctor Strange also boasts some of the best special effects in recent memory. The major problem is the plot, as this is becoming almost redundant and predictable in the MCU origin films.

Psychedelic, entertaining, Benedict Cumberbatch is hot af fight me, but The Ancient One absolutely should have been portrayed by a Southeast Asian actress. Preferably someone from, oh I don't know, Nepal???
