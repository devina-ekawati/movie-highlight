Dazzling effects and enthusiastic performances launch the latest entry into the MCU with finesse. Cumberbatch delivers an intriguing character who expertly fits the successful design of Marvel's recent protagonists, matching heroic action and paced humor without succumbing to predictable constraints, and a well-balanced cast of expert actors and actresses carries a script filled with action, comedy, and mystery. Scott Derrickson's direction ties it all together without ever disengaging viewers, resulting in one of the most entertaining and visually magnificent spectacles of the MCU to date. A worthy entry to the existing saga and a thoroughly entertaining film on its' own, "Doctor Strange" entrances and excites -- well worth a chance from Marvel loyalists and newcomers alike.
One of the top few MCU movies, visually stunning, thrilling and much funnier than I was expecting (for some reason). I'd heard about the whitewashing thing, and while it's certainly unfortunate and problematic, and Michelle Yeoh (for instance) would probably have also made a good Ancient One, Tilda is undeniably fantastic in the role (as always). Ditto Benibatch, Ejiofor, McAdams, Wong and Mikkelsen. Given the magical stuff, it felt a bit apart from the other Avenger movies - not a bad thing - but as soon as Wong said 'infinity stone' it slid into place. Time will tell (sorry) how the good doctor plays with the established (and yet to be established) Avengers, but as a standalone film this one rocks.
amazing film!
